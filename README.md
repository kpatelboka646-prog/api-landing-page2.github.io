API Studio — Version 5 (full code)

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- logo.png (place in same folder)
- document.html (download target - replace with your document)

Key fixes & features:
- Full-page dark/light theme using CSS variables; fixes mobile partial-screen dark bug by applying theme to both <html> and <body>.
- Theme persisted in localStorage; toggle accessible via keyboard and has ARIA attributes.
- Mobile-first responsive grid (1 → 2 → 4 columns).
- Strong typography with Roboto Mono headings (keeps the 01/02 feel).
- Clear "OPEN" action on each tile reduces confusion for users.
- Meta theme-color updated dynamically for mobile browser chrome color.
- Minimal JS (fast) and reduced-motion support.

How to use:
1. Put `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and `logo.png` in same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in modern browser.
3. Replace the tile `href` links with your actual pages (news.html, nasa.html, books.html, ai.html, bank.html, arxiv.html, museum.html, one.html).
4. Replace `document.html` with your real API doc file.

If you want, I can now:
- Generate the 8 matching subpages using the same design (mock search + card templates), or
- Package everything in a ZIP with placeholder images and `logo.png`.
